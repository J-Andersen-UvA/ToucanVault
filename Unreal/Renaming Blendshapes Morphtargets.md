### Why morph target renaming doesn’t work inside Unreal Engine through script yet

Even though there is a: <span class="blue">bool RenameMorphTarget (FName InOldName, FName InNewName)</span> in Engine/SkeletalMesh.h, it does not seem to be working. I got as far as renaming the names we can see visually in the skeletalmesh editor, and automatically changing the names in the skeleton curves (which is needed I will explain in a second). But still it did not work.
