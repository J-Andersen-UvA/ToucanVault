## Retiming animations
To speed up or slow down parts, split the animation (ctrl+/) part that needs retiming. Hold ctrl and hover close to the animation edge, you will see a clock:

ctrl+drag to scale the timing.

### <span class="red">!Crash Warning!</span>
If you ctrl+drag, let go of ctrl, and keep dragging, Unreal will crash. Letting go of mouse button first and then ctrl will prevent this.
