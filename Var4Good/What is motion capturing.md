## What is motion capturing?


---
## Why motion capture?

---

- How does motion capturing markers work?
	- Active - versus passivetracking, marker versus markerless
	- Retro-Reflective markers (show marker, show flash, explain infrared)
	- Infrared cameras, no location data yet
	- Triangulation for cameras during calibration
	- Marker tracking available, but no identification yet.
- How does motion capturing humans work?
	- Labelling passive markers
	- Solving into a skeleton
	- Motion capturing a face
