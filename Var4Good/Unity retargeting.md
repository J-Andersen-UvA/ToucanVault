[Animation Retargeting (Unity Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNgPkuMgWFg)

How does it work:
1. **Unified Humanoid Avatar**
	- Unity defines a fixed skeleton for humans
	- Imported anims get mapped onto this skeleton
2. Unity's muscle-based system
	- abstract muscle values, a combination of DOF and range of motion. Enables us to limit or extend the retargeted motions of a character.
3. IK correction
	- Use IK for foot locking and hand goals to clean up the poses
