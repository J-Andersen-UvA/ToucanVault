Make sure going into blender, that we do not touch too many settings. Wrong orientations in bones are not an issue there as long as we are being consistent for the animations and the mesh.

For the mesh we need to consider the hair:
- Getting out of Unreal into Blender: [[Hair in Blender]]
- Going into Babylonjs and loading the mesh in Babylon: [[Hair in BabylonJS]]
